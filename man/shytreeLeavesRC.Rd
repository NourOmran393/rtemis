\arguments{
\item{x}{Data frame}

\item{max.leaves}{Integer: Total number of terminal nodes to reach. 1 is a special case where no split is performed and a linear
model is trained. Otherwise, this should be an even number as each split introduces two children nodes.
Note: this is total N of nodes in the tree, with the root uncounted, not the number of terminal nodes.}

\item{loss.fn}{Function with arguments y, Fval, weights. Allows you to define a custom loss function.}
}
\description{
Train an Stepwise Hybrid Tree for Classification & Regression
}
\details{
With \code{max.nodes = 0}, the model is logistic regression trained according to \code{lin.type}
(i.e. standard or regularized using glmnet, etc.)
Note that lambda is treated differently by \code{glmnet::glmnet} and \code{MASS::lm.ridge}
